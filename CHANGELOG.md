#### Version - 4.0.1.0 - 4/18/2025
* Fixed subfolders of profiles showing up under additional profiles within compiler settings
* Fixed Nexus login not taking cancellation token into account while waiting for authorization (closing the Nexus login prompt did not work)
* Added 2FA support for MEGA login, added some extra logging for MEGA logins
  * Special thanks to [@erri120](https://www.github.com/erri120) who originally implemented part of this in Wabbajack and the MegaApiClient library 4 years ago, which made the change rather easy
* Added a warning for when WebView is not loading
* Add progress indicator to the publish button after compilation (thanks to [@JanuarySnow](https://www.github.com/JanuarySnow))
* Improve validation before being able to install, should avoid users installing to important folders/the Wabbajack installation directory
* Adjusted the in-app log viewer to not constantly queue updates but to update it periodically instead to avoid freezes when too many log rows are queued (thanks to [@JanuarySnow](https://www.github.com/JanuarySnow))

#### Version - 4.0.0.3 - 3/20/2025
* Fixed the open logs folder button not actually opening the logs folder on a failed installation
* Fixed the missing manual report incorrectly listing Nexus files
  * The missing manual report will now be generated with clickable links to the Wabbajack downloads folder
* Added MEGA anonymous login feature
  * This was previously available in older Wabbajack 3.7 versions, but it broke due to MEGA introducing a new security feature to protect against bots.
  * I was looking at fixing this up so the anonymous login would work again, but to my surprise it worked straight away without making any changes.
  * Thus, both the option to use an account and the option to use the anonymous login have now been made available within the MEGA login menu.
* Adjusted wording of 'failed to download' to 'failed to source' in the description for a failed download installation error, since certain files (game files) aren't actually downloaded


#### Version - 4.0.0.2 - 3/19/2025
* Fixed an issue where previous installation paths might not be remembered correctly
  * From this version onwards, Wabbajack will additionally remember previous installations by .wabbajack filename instead of only by the full install path being the same
* Replaced Play button after installation completes with Open Install Folder
* Added 'Create Desktop Shortcut' button after installation completes
* 'Open File Explorer' after a failed installation has been renamed to 'Open Logs Folder' as it better describes what the button does
* Octopus.Octodiff NuGet library has been updated from 2.0.547 to 2.0.548

#### Version - 4.0.0.1 - 3/18/2025
* Fixed an issue where manual downloads would get stuck after only a few browser pop-ups
* Fixed the new Wabbajack reset working not working in some cases
* The MEGA login timeout has been increased to 30 seconds from 10 seconds to hopefully help with login errors.
* GPU detection logic has been adjusted to account for virtual video controllers and video controllers without a reported refresh rate (thanks to [@kaeltis](https://www.github.com/kaeltis))

#### Version - 4.0.0.0 - 3/17/2025
* The entire UI has been overhauled to hopefully better guide users during installation/compilation and such.
  * Major thanks to [@CritLoren](https://www.github.com/CritLoren) for coming up with a lot of ideas behind the redesign and creating [Figma mock-ups](https://www.figma.com/design/SylohOBwdYAtPbOj5VMQ25/Wabbajack-v4).
  * This changelog won't go into detail into every bit, as I ([@tr4wzified](https://www.github.com/tr4wzified)) have been working on this for over a year now and I don't think anyone is going to be reading all of the changes anyway.
  * For some comparison shots, scroll to the bottom of the changelog for this version!
  * Good to know; despite the major version number increase, modlists from 3.7.5.3 are fully compatible with 4.0.0.0 and do not need to be recompiled by the modlist author.
* The tag system has been overhauled. Only tags on [the whitelist](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/mod-lists/blob/master/allowed_tags.json) will show up on modlists.
  * This was done to standardize tags and make tag search more meaningful. The website has not been updated for this yet.
* You can now search by tag within Wabbajack.
* You can now search modlists by mod within Wabbajack. This is currently limited to mods from the Nexus.
* Wabbajack now automatically suggests installation and downloads folders. [Click here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84029c2a-396d-42bb-8736-eeef9cf66b18) for an overview of how this algorithm works!
* The readme is now readable within Wabbajack itself, during installation and when previewing the modlist (when clicking on it in the gallery).
* Fixed issues with non-featured / NSFW toggles not resetting properly in some cases.
* Fixed issues with (gallery) images not loading on certain Windows installations without the Webp Image Extensions installed.
* The gallery has been optimized to use smaller thumbnail images, saving on memory and loading times.
* Search functions in the gallery have been improved to sort by best matching result.
  * For example, searching for 'Ro' previously could show the 'Tahrovin' list first, simply because it also contained the word 'Ro'.
* A total modlist size filter has been added to the gallery.
* Installation and compilation cancel buttons have been added - for when things are taking too long and you just want to play games with your friends ;)
* The settings menu has been overhauled as well adding some neat features!
  * Resource settings can now be edited within the app without the need to open an external text editor with a settings json file, saves immediately after being changed
  * New drag & drop upload features for the CDN
  * A reset button is now available in-app that will delete **all** Wabbajack settings and restart the application.
* Modlist authors: texture recompression is now disabled by default due to it causing issues on specific FNV setups. You can optionally toggle it back on to try and shave some space off a compiled modlist.
* Modlist authors: a websiteURL can now be added to your modlist JSON entry (modlists.json), it's a separate button available before installation.
* Modlist authors: Managing multiple modlists is now easier with the compilation overview menu, showing other previously compiled modlists and being able to swap between them easily.
* The missing manual report document now properly links to download URLs and provides additional information on resolving issues with specific game files.
* Fixed the Google Drive downloader not working properly, should be fully automated once again.
* A MEGA login is now required for modlists requiring MEGA downloads.
  * This is due to MEGA implementing additional security measures to block bots. Once I have some time I will investigate further and see if anonymous logins can be brought back.
* Improved logging in various places, a few examples below:
  * Drives are now logged including details about available free space and the drive type (SSD, HDD etc).
  * System specifications are now logged more extensively, including GPU
  * Installation and downloads folders are now logged when starting a Wabbajack installation
* Fixed issue where Wabbajack could get stuck doing nothing when pressing install immediately after loading a list for installation.
* Extra logging has been added that should cause message boxes with descriptive errors to pop up for people that are having issues launching Wabbajack instead of silent failures.
* Wabbajack will now ignore trailing commas and comments within JSON files. However, I ask you do not try this out, stick to normal JSON conventions please ;)
* When one modlist repository breaks (for example, due to invalid JSON), this will no longer cause the entire Wabbajack gallery to go down. Only the lists on broken repositories will no longer show up.
* Last but not least, fonts are now shipped within the application. No more ugly serif fonts for Linux WINE users, I see you!

#### Version - 3.7.5.2 - 1/12/2025 
* Fix for Wabbajack not fully utilizing saturating network speed because a download library added for resumable downloads was poorly optimized. Thanks to Thamous ([@AlexDickerson](https://github.com/AlexDickerson)).
* Fix for situations where Wabbajack might send an excessive amount of OAuth requests resulting in hitting Nexus rate limits, causing a temporary ban. Thanks to Thamous ([@AlexDickerson](https://github.com/AlexDickerson)).
* Fix for the Wabbajack gallery going down after a new repository is added because the gallery was accidentally dependent on the tests running the validation report.
* Fix 7 Days to Die support not working properly. Thanks to [@JanuarySnow][https://github.com/JanuarySnow).


#### Version - 3.7.5.1 - 11/23/2024
* Reverted "Wabbajack will now put modfile Titles, Description and Version into the `.meta` file." as it didn't account for formatting in descriptions that could confuse the iniparser

* Fixed a bug with the html reports when in a folder with a space in the name

#### Version - 3.7.2.0 - 8/25/2024
* Added a new button to the installer configuration window for verifying installs. This runs the same code as the verify CLI command, now it's in the UI for easier access. The output of this command
is written to a `.html` file and opened in the default browser.
* When a modlist install fails due to one or more missing non-nexus files, the installer will now write a `.html` file with all the links and instructions, and open it with the default browser. This data was
previsoously only written to the log file.

#### Version - 3.7.1.1 - 8/13/2024
* HOTFIX: buggy release pipeline caused some corruption in the files of 3.7.1.0

* Support for DirectURL use with LL files

#### Version - 3.5.0.2 - 5/21/2024
* *HOTFIX* - change how we log into Nexus Mods. We still need to rewrite this on
  Oauth2, but this should fix the current issues we have, and get people back up and running

#### Version - 3.5.0.1 - 1/15/2024
* *HOTFIX* - change the cache file names so files will be auto-rehashed

#### Version - 3.5.0.0 - 1/15/2024
* Fixed a *long* standing bug with the BSA reader. This problem has existed for at least 4 years, but was never seen
  till now. The latest Skyrim updates exposed the error. If a file inside a BSA was compressed and the compressed file
  size was *exactly* the same as the uncompressed file, WJ would not decompress the file and instead write out the raw
  LZ4 data. This would caus a ton of issues all throughout the app. 
* Modlist Authors: Delete your VFS cache, hash cache, and recompile your list from scratch. This will ensure that all
  files are properly decompressed and properly reindexed. 

#### Version - 3.4.2.0 - 1/14/2024
* Updated GameFinder to 4.1.0
  * Fixes Wabbajack not Launching on some systems

* Fixed the Nexus API key no longer being picked up when logging in
* Fixed Baldur's Gate 3 having to be named 'badlursgate3' instead of 'baldursgate3' when defining a modlist JSON
* Fixed wabbajack-cli.bat pointing to the wrong CLI executable path

#### Version - 3.4.1.0 - 12/21/2023
* Added Support for Final Fantasy 7: Remake Intergrade
* Update CLI to .NET 8.0 (was missed in the last update)
* Added Support for Baldur's Gate 3 
  * Very Work in Progress
  * **NOT** Plug and Play for compiling and installing!
* Fixed a logging error when closing the App without a `temp` folder to delete

#### Version - 3.4.0.0 - 11/19/2023
* Fixed `--outputPath` not being used for the CLI `compile` (thanks to @majcosta for fixing that)
* Improved Log message for cases where low storage on the drive Wabbajack is installed on causes compiles to fail
  * **To list authors still compiling on Wabbajack 3.0.5.0:**  
    This is what is causing your compiles with any newer Wabbajack version to fail.
    The reason the compile works is that you already have a full cache for all your mods and BSAs with that version and WJ only needs to add a small amount of new files to that cache and needs less temporary drive space because of that. Any version higher than 3.0.5.0 needs a new cache that can't be converted and needs WJ to unpack every Archive (zip/rar/7z/BSA/BA2) and add the files inside to the new cache.  
    Finding ways to reduce the storage footprint when compiling huge lists for the first time (since any following compiles won't need that space requirement anymore) will be investigated.
* Wabbajack will now clean the `temp` folder when closed
* Updated Dependencies
  * LZ4 to version 1.3.7-beta
  * SharpZipLib to version 1.4.2

* Fixed manual downloader downloading in the OS's "Downloads" folder
* Added RAM Limit setting for downloads
  * This fixes the High RAM usage (and sometimes app crashes) on some Hardware + Very High Speed Internet Connection Systems
* Added Fallout 4 (GOG) to the index
* Updated App to .NET 8.0
  * Should fix random crashes on some systems
* Updated GameFinder to 4.0.0

#### Version - 3.2.0.1 - 7/23/2023
  * Code cleanup: re-added some network and diagnostic code missing since 2.5

#### Version - 3.2.0.0 - 7/16/2023
* Fixed issues related to high RAM usage
* The resumable downloads now reserve drive space to write to in advance instead of being managed in system RAM

* Check all links during mod list creation
* Generate a installation report during compilation
* Show the report after compiling
* Added a button to view the report before installing

  that is copied directly into a modfile (commonly used for `SSE Terrain Tamriel.esm`)
* Fix crash caused by multiple downloads with the same SHA256
* Putting `WABBAJACK_ALWAYS_ENABLE` on a mod's notes/comments will cause it to always be included in the modlist, even if disabled
* All `.json`, `.ini`, and `.yaml` files that contain remappable paths are now inlined and remapped.
* If Wabbajack finds a file called `otherprofiles.txt` inside the compiled profile's folder. Then that file is assumed
  to be a list of other profiles to be included in the install. This list should be the name of a profile, one name per line.
* Can now set the download folder both during compilation and installation.
* Any config files pointing to the download folder are remapped.
* Refuse to run inside `downloads` folders (anti-virus watches these files too closely and it can cause VFS issues)
* Refuse to run if MO2 is on the system installed in non-portable mode (otherwise broken installs may result)
* Config files that don't otherwise match a rule are inlined into the modlist
* Warn users before installing into an existing MO2 install folder (prevents unintentional data loss from overwriting existing data #24)
* Fix for read only folder deletion bug (#23)
* Include version numbers and SHAs in the install report
* Removed option to endorse mods, Nexus devs mentioned it was of questionable worth, I (halgari) agree

#### Version 0.8.1 - 8/29/2019
* Fixed a bug that was causing VFS temp folders not to be cleaned
* 7zip Extraction code now shows a progress bar
* Told 7zip not to ask for permission before overwriting a file (should fix the hanging installer problem)
* Fixed several places where we were using long-path incompatible file routines
* Changed the work queue from FIFO to LIFO which results in depth-first work instead of breadth-first
  TLDR: We now fully analyze a single archive before moving on to the next.



#### Version 0.8 - 8/26/2019
* Mod folders that contain ESMs with names matching the Skyrim core ESMs are assumed to be cleaned versions of the core
  game mods, and will be patched from the ESMs found in the game folder. **Note:** if you have also cleaned the files in the Skyrim
  folder, this will result in a broken install. The ESMs in the game folder should be the original ESMs, the cleaned
  ESMs should go into their own mod. These files currently only include:
    * `Update.esm`
    * `Dragonborn.esm`
    * `HearthFires.esm`
    * `Dawnguard.esm`
* `ModOrganizer.ini` is now interpreted and included as part of the install. As part of the install users will be asked
  to point to their game folder, and then all the references to the MO2 folder or Game folder in `ModOrganizer.ini` will
  be remapped to the new locations.
* Progress bars were added to several install/hashing and compilation instructions
* 7zip routines were rewritten to use subprocesses instead of a C# library. This will result in slower indexing and installation
  but should have full compatability with all usable archive formats. It should also reduce total memory usage during extraction.
* Added the ability to endorse all used mods at the completion of an install
* Custom LOOT rules are now included in a special folder in MO2 after install. Users can use this to quickly import new LOOT rules.
* Moved the VFS cache from using BSON to a custom binary encoding. Much faster read/write times and greatly reduced memory usage.
  **Note:** This means that modlist authors will have to re-index their archives with this version. This is automatic but the first
  compilation will take quite some time while the cache reindexes.
